To work with me effectively, you'll need to:

At Start of Each Conversation:
```
YOU: "Read PROMPT.md and confirm understanding"
ME: [Must state current goal and approach]
YOU: [Validate my understanding]
```
During Development:

```YOU: Regular checkpoints:
- "Are you following PROMPT.md?"
- "How does this align with our goal?"
- "Show me the specific Apple pattern"```

ME: Must:
- State goal before each action
- Get explicit approval for changes
- Reference specific patterns
If I Start to Drift:

```YOU: "Stop and re-read PROMPT.md"
ME: Must acknowledge and realign```
