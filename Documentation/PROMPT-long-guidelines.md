# === SECTION END ===

# === SECTION START: Implementation Patterns ===
[PRIORITY: CRITICAL]

PATTERN: Timing Management
CORRECT: 
✅ RealityKit deltaTime
✅ Component-level elapsed time
✅ State-based duration tracking

INCORRECT:
❌ CACurrentMediaTime()
❌ Date().timeIntervalSince1970
❌ DispatchTime.now()

DECISION TREE: Timing Implementation
IF: Need frame-by-frame timing
THEN: Use update context deltaTime
ELSE IF: Need state duration
THEN: Use component elapsedTime
ELSE IF: Need animation timing
THEN: Use RealityKit animation system

PATTERN: State Management
CORRECT:
✅ Dedicated state components
✅ RealityKit update cycle
✅ Clean state transitions

VALIDATION:
[ ] Pattern exists in reference projects
[ ] Compatible with visionOS
[ ] Performance impact assessed
[ ] State management considered
